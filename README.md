# POETradeFuzzySearch
When searching on pathofexile.com/trade, this addon inserts the tilde(~) before your search query. This enables fuzzy search, so you can be more lenient with your search.

For example, when searching for "#% to Fire and Cold Resistance" it's enought to just write "fire cold res". Without fuzzy search, this would not find the modifier.
